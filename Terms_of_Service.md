_Last updated: 25 Sep 2025_

## 1. Acceptance of Terms  
By inviting **JAI** (the “Bot”) to a Discord server or interacting with it in any way, you (“User,” “Server Owner,” or “Administrator”) agree to be bound by:  
- These Terms of Service (the “Terms”)  
- Discord’s Terms of Service[12]  
- Discord’s Developer Policy[14]  

If you do not accept these Terms, remove the Bot from your server and discontinue use immediately.

## 2. Service Description  
JAI provides AI-powered chat responses, role automation, music playback, server logging, and analytics. Features may change, be added, or removed at any time without notice.

## 3. Eligibility  
You must be at least 13 years old (or older if required by your local jurisdiction) and have permission to manage the Discord server where JAI is installed.

## 4. User Responsibilities  
- **Compliance:** Ensure Bot use follows Discord rules, your local laws, and these Terms.  
- **Content:** You are responsible for any content submitted to or generated by the Bot in your server.  
- **Moderation:** Configure Bot permissions carefully; JAI’s actions reflect your server’s governance.

## 5. Prohibited Conduct  
You may not:  
- Attempt to reverse-engineer, modify, or create derivative works of the Bot.  
- Use the Bot to harass, spam, or violate intellectual-property rights.  
- Collect personal data from users beyond that disclosed in the Privacy Policy.  
- Exploit vulnerabilities or probe JAI’s infrastructure.

## 6. Intellectual Property  
All code, branding, and AI prompts used by JAI are owned by JadaDev or its licensors. “JAI” and associated graphics are trademarks of JadaDev.

## 7. Availability & Updates  
The Bot is provided **“as-is” and “as-available.”** We may suspend or terminate the service, impose rate limits, or push updates automatically without liability.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties  
JAI makes **no warranties**—express or implied—regarding accuracy, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Use at your own risk[12].

## 9. Limitation of Liability  
To the maximum extent permitted by law, JadaDev shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from Bot use, even if advised of the possibility.

## 10. Indemnification  
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless JadaDev, its affiliates, and staff from any claim or demand arising out of your use of JAI or violation of these Terms.

## 11. Termination  
We may remove the Bot from your server or revoke access at any time for breach of these Terms or Discord policies. You may remove the Bot at any time.

## 12. Changes to Terms  
We may revise these Terms with 7 days’ notice posted in the support server or via the Bot’s `/about` command. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
